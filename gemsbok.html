    <h3>GEMSBOKS</h3>
    <p>Gemsboks are large antelopes of the oryx genus native to arid regions of Southern Africa. They are known for their long, straight horns and bold black-and-white markings on their faces and legs. Both males and females have horns, which can be used for defense against predators like lions and hyenas.</p>
    <p>Gemsboks are highly adapted to desert life. They can survive without drinking water for weeks, getting moisture from wild melons, roots, and desert vegetation. Their light-colored coats reflect heat, and they are most active during cooler parts of the day. Social in nature, gemsboks live in herds led by dominant females.</p>
    <p>They graze on grasses and browse on shrubs and trees, moving across wide areas in search of food. Their grace, speed, and resilience make them one of the most impressive antelope species in Africa.</p>
    <h3> WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</h3>
    <p>You will find the gemsboks in pen A14, near the dryland habitat exhibit.</p>
