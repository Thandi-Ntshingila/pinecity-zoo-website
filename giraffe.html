    <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
    <p>Giraffes are the tallest land animals on Earth, with males growing up to 5.5 meters tall. They are native to African savannahs and woodlands. Their long necks help them reach leaves from tall trees, particularly acacias, which make up the bulk of their diet.</p>
    <p>Giraffes have unique coat patterns that help with camouflage and identifying individuals. Their long, dark tongues can grasp and strip leaves from branches. Despite their height, giraffes have only seven neck vertebraeâ€”the same number as humans.</p>
    <p>They live in loose social groups and communicate through infrasound. Giraffes have powerful kicks that can deter predators like lions. Due to habitat loss and human encroachment, giraffe populations have declined, and conservation efforts are underway to protect them.</p>
    <h3> WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</h3>
    <p>You will find the giraffes in pen B10, next to the observation deck and tall tree grove.</p>
