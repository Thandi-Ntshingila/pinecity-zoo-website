    <h3>GORILLAS</h3>
    <p>Gorillas are the largest primates and are closely related to humans, sharing about 98% of our DNA. They are native to the dense forests of central Africa. Gorillas are gentle giants that live in family groups led by a dominant silverback male.</p>
    <p>They feed primarily on fruits, leaves, and stems. Gorillas use vocalizations, chest beating, and body language to communicate. Despite their intimidating size, they are shy and peaceful when left undisturbed.</p>
    <p>Habitat destruction, disease, and poaching threaten their survival. Mountain gorillas, a critically endangered subspecies, are the focus of major conservation efforts. Gorillas are intelligent and emotional animals, capable of learning sign language and forming deep social bonds.</p>
   <h3> WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</h3>
    <p>You will find the gorillas in pen G01, inside the tropical forest enclosure with observation platforms.</p>
