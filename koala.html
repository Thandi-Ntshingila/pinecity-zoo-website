    <h3>KOALAS</h3>
    <p>Koalas are marsupials native to eastern and southern Australia. They live in eucalyptus forests and spend most of their time sleeping in tree branches. Koalas feed almost exclusively on eucalyptus leaves, which are low in nutrients and toxic to most animals. Their specialized digestive systems detoxify the leaves and extract enough moisture to survive without frequent water.</p>
    <p>Koalas are solitary and mostly nocturnal. They have strong limbs and sharp claws for climbing trees. Females carry their young, called joeys, in a pouch for about six months. Koalas sleep up to 20 hours a day to conserve energy due to their low-calorie diet.</p>
    <p>Threats to koalas include habitat destruction, bushfires, and disease. They are a symbol of Australian wildlife and are listed as vulnerable in many parts of their range.</p>
   <h3> WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</h3>
    <p>You will find the koalas in pen C05, inside the eucalyptus tree exhibit near the Australian zone.</p>
