    <h3>LIONS</h3>
    <p>Lions are large carnivorous mammals known as the "kings of the jungle." Native to Africa and a small part of India, lions live in grasslands, savannahs, and open woodlands. Unlike other big cats, lions are social and live in groups called prides, which consist of related females, their cubs, and one or more dominant males.</p>
    <p>Male lions are easily recognized by their manes, which vary in color and size. Lions are apex predators, hunting animals like zebras, wildebeests, and buffalo. Females do most of the hunting, while males protect the prideâ€™s territory from rivals.</p>
    <p>Though iconic, lions face challenges due to poaching, human conflict, and habitat loss. Conservation programs work to ensure their survival in the wild and in protected reserves.</p>
    <h3> WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</h3>
    <p>You will find the lions in pen E01, overlooking the central savannah viewing area.</p>
