    <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
    <p>Monkeys are a diverse group of primates found across Asia, Africa, and the Americas. They are typically divided into two groups: Old World monkeys (e.g., baboons and macaques) and New World monkeys (e.g., capuchins and howler monkeys). Monkeys vary greatly in size, color, and behavior but are known for their agility, intelligence, and complex social structures.</p>
    <p>Monkeys are omnivorous and have a diet that includes fruits, leaves, insects, eggs, and sometimes small animals. Many species are highly social and live in groups where grooming, communication, and play are essential for bonding.</p>
    <p>They use a variety of vocalizations, facial expressions, and gestures to interact. Unfortunately, many monkey species face habitat destruction, hunting, and the illegal pet trade, leading to declining populations in the wild.</p>
      <h3>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</h3>
    <p>Monkeys are in pen F06, along the rainforest trail with ropes and trees for climbing enrichment.</p>
