    <h3>PANDAS</h3>
    <p>Pandas, also known as giant pandas, are large bears native to the mountain forests of central China. They are famous for their black-and-white coats and gentle personalities. Pandas mainly eat bamboo, consuming up to 40 kilograms per day. Although they are classified as carnivores, their diet is 99% plant-based.</p>
    <p>Pandas have strong jaws and molars to chew bamboo stalks. They spend most of their time eating or resting. Each panda has distinct facial markings, and they are solitary animals by nature. Females usually give birth to one or two cubs, though only one typically survives in the wild.</p>
    <p>Pandas were once on the brink of extinction, but conservation efforts, especially in China, have helped their numbers recover. They are currently listed as vulnerable.</p>
      <h3>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</h3>
    <p>You will find the pandas in pen D03, in the cool bamboo forest area of the zoo.</p>
