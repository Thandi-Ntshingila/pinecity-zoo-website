    <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
    <p>Warthogs are wild members of the pig family, found in grasslands and savannahs of sub-Saharan Africa. They are known for their prominent tusks, facial warts, and bristly manes. Despite their rugged appearance, warthogs are social and intelligent animals.</p>
    <p>Warthogs primarily eat grasses, roots, and tubers. They kneel on their front legs while grazing and can run quickly when threatened. They often take shelter in burrows dug by other animals, backing in to defend themselves with their tusks facing outward.</p>
    <p>They live in family groups called sounders, usually led by a dominant female. Warthogs are prey for lions, leopards, and hyenas but are well-equipped to defend themselves.</p>
    <h3>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</h3>
    <p>You will find the warthogs in pen D09, near the savannah zone adjacent to the zebra habitat.</p>
